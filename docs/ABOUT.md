# About

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is a pure, lazy, strongly typed, functional programming language that is used as a DSL for the Nix package manager.

Nix's laziness makes it a great choice for package management because expressions are not evaluated until they are needed.
Purity means that functions do not have unexpected side-effects.

The largest library of Nix expressions is the [Nixpkgs](http://nixpkgs.org) package repository (containing over 80,000 packages).
The Nix package manager enables building software that is reproducible and portable across different systems.
